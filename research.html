  The Interest Rate Elasticity of Investment: Micro Estimates and Macro Implications</a><br>
  
  <div style="color: Black; margin-left: 40px"> 
I estimate the elasticity of investment to interest rates using cross-sectional variation and high-frequency monetary shocks. My estimates imply that a 1 p.p. decrease in interest rates increases capital demand by 4% eight quarters after the shock. This indicates a significant effect of interest rates on investment but is much smaller than prominent estimates of the interest rate elasticity derived from the investment response to tax policy changes. In a quantitative model with heterogeneous firms, I show that the impulse response I estimate provides a powerful tool to discriminate between models with different frictions. The evidence favors models with external financing constraints, while models with large real adjustment costs cannot match evidence from both interest rate and tax policy shocks.

   From Pensions to Personnel: The Incentive Effects of Retirement Reform on Retention</a><br> (with Kristy Kim)
     <div style="color: Black; margin-left: 40px"> 
Private retirement plans are a crucial part of workerâ€™s compensation in the U.S. and have long been thought to influence labor supply. This study uses a cohort-based regression discontinuity design to examine how a change in the retirement plan at the largest U.S. employer, the Federal Government, impacted the retention of employees over the entire life cycle. We find that workers with a retirement plan that featured less valuable employer pensions but more portable retirement benefits were more likely to separate from the government. We find smaller, statistically insignificant effects in the first few years of employment but large reductions in the probability that workers remain with the government between 15 and 30 years after beginning federal service. This change did not alter the number or characteristics of new hires. We also find evidence that the effects are driven by highly productive workers, identified through supplemental compensation or early promotions. Hence, while the change in the plan saved the government money, it came at the cost of reduced retention of valuable employees. Our results suggest that employees respond to changes in the value of retirement benefits by leaving employers for better outside options, but that employees may be inattentive or job-locked early in their careers.

   The Incidence and Efficiency of Land Value Taxation</a><br> (with Ulf Nielsson and Anders Yding) [New Draft Coming Soon!]
      <div style="color: Black; margin-left: 40px"> 
Despite limited empirical evidence, land value taxes (LVT) have long been viewed as uniquely desirable because the fixed supply of land implies no efficiency cost of taxation and that incumbent landowners bear the entire incidence of the tax. We use a unique quasi-experiment that generated persistent, formula-based variation in LVT rates across Danish towns to study the incidence and efficiency properties of taxes on land. In contrast to the predictions of neoclassical models, we estimate a precise zero effect of land taxes on residential housing prices, suggesting that taxes are not capitalized into home prices. Our estimates allow us to rule out capitalization of taxes into home prices at standard discount rates and imply the incidence of the tax is borne by tenants and future purchasers rather than incumbent landowners. Consistent with standard models, we estimate null effects of land taxes on measures of housing development, mobility, and homeownership. Our results are consistent with limited efficiency costs of land value taxation but imply that the tax is regressive because it is paid by renters rather than landowners.</div>
