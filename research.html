  The Interest Rate Elasticity of Investment: Micro Estimates and Macro Implications</a><br>
</p>
<div align="justify" style="color: Black; margin-left: 40px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
	I estimate the elasticity of investment to interest rates using cross-sectional variation and high-frequency monetary shocks. 
	My estimates imply that a 1 p.p. decrease in interest rates increases capital demand by 4% eight quarters after the shock. 
	This indicates a significant effect of interest rates on investment but is much smaller than prominent estimates of the interest rate elasticity 
	derived from the investment response to tax policy changes. In a quantitative model with heterogeneous firms, I show that the impulse response I 
	estimate provides a powerful tool to discriminate between models with different frictions. The evidence favors models with external financing constraints, 
	while models with large real adjustment costs cannot match evidence from both interest rate and tax policy shocks.

   The Incidence and Efficiency of Land Value Taxation</a><br> (with Ulf Nielsson and Anders Yding)
   </p>
   <div align="justify" style="color: Black; margin-left: 40px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
	Land value taxes are often seen as particularly desirable because the fixed supply of land implies no efficiency loss from taxation, 
	with the entire tax burden falling on current landowners. We use a unique quasi-experiment that generated persistent variation in 
	land tax rates across Danish municipalities to study the incidence and efficiency of land taxes. In contrast to the predictions of standard, 
	neoclassical models, we estimate a precise zero effect of land taxes on residential home prices. Our estimates allow us to rule out full 
	capitalization of taxes into home values at high discount rates and imply that the tax burden is shared with tenants and future purchasers. 
	We also estimate null effects of land taxes on measures of housing development, mobility, and homeownership, though we do find older homeowners 
	sort away from high tax areas. Our results are consistent with limited efficiency costs of land value taxation, but imply that land taxes are 
	more regressive than predicted by standard models.

   From Pensions to Personnel: The Incentive Effects of Retirement Reform on Retention</a><br> (with Kristy Kim)
   </p>
   <div align="justify" style="color: Black; margin-left: 40px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
	Private retirement plans are a crucial part of workerâ€™s compensation in the U.S. and have long been thought to influence labor supply. 
	This study uses a cohort-based regression discontinuity design to examine how a change in the retirement plan at the largest U.S. employer, 
	the Federal Government, impacted the retention of employees over the entire life cycle. We find that workers with less valuable employer 
	pensions but more portable retirement benefits were more likely to separate from the government around 15 and 30 years after beginning federal 
	service. We find smaller, statistically insignificant effects in the first few years of employment. We also find evidence that the effects are driven 
	by highly productive workers, identified through supplemental compensation or early promotions. Our results suggest that employees respond to changes 
	in the value of retirement benefits by leaving employers for better outside options, but that employees may be inattentive or job-locked early in their 
	careers. These findings demonstrate that non-wage compensation impacts labor supply decisions across a worker's lifecycle and the distribution of human 
	capital over time, particularly in labor markets where employers compete through diverse compensation structures.
